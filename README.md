# Learning from Missingness: Enhancing imputation with the NN3 architecture to predict monthly US common stock returns


## Highlights: 

- Conducted data preprocessing and feature engineering using Compustat accounting data, JKP monthly factors returns and CRSP Security-Level Prices database from 1961 to 2024

- Building a three stage pipeline model that combines Random Forest-based feature selection, hyperparameter optimization and a Neural Network trained on rolling windows to     predict monthly US common stock returns

- Designed and tested varying regularization schemes; introduced a **NaN Flag Matrix** to encode missingness as a predictive signal, enhancing imputation and model performance.

- Achieved a **net-of-cost positive return** over a 40-year backtest period through a systematic trading strategy driven by the model’s forecasts.

Full prediction results are available upon request or can be regenerated using the pipeline.

## Running the NN3 code:

To run the code, make sure the data file is inside of the folder. CHange the parameters as you wish in the config.py file.

Then, Simply execute the main.py file in the terminal.
