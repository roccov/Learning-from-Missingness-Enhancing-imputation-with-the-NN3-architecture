# This repository contains the project 

• Conducted data preprocessing and feature engineering using Compustat accounting data, JKP monthly factors returns and CRSP Security-Level Prices database from 1961 to 2024
• Building a three stage pipeline model that combines Random Forest-based feature selection, hyperparameter optimization and a Neural Network trained on rolling windows to predict monthly US common stock returns
• Designed and tested varying regularization schemes; introduced a NaN Flag Matrix to encode missingness as a predictive signal, enhancing imputation and model performance.
• Achieved a net-of-cost positive return over a 40-year backtest period through a systematic trading strategy driven by the model’s forecasts.
